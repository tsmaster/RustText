./target/debug/demo_1

cargo add macroquad





-- note that once_cell is not working, it's an unstable feature with my version of rustc

#![feature(once_cell)]

-- switch to nightly:
rustup default nightly
-- oh, but the nightly version says that once_cell is actually stable
rustup default stable
-- oh, but I need to update
rustup update
-- rustc 1.73.0
-- rustc 1.75.0-nightly

-- bleh, drivers need a reboot


---

-- moved the demo to examples/demo_1/main.rs

cargo run --example demo_1

-- Next up: make a Panel struct, maybe a Panel trait, that has putchar()-like API
   and can draw itself in a single draw() call


---
-- made a WASM build by
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --example demo_2
cp target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/debug/examples/demo_2.wasm Web/demo2.wasm
cp assets/* Web/assets/

--then grabbed index.html from the macroquad github page, copied into Web

-- then tested locally

basic-http-server Web/

-- then copied Web folder to S3
